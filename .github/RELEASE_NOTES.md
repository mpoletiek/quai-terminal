Quai Terminal is a keyboard-first CLI and TUI wallet for Quai Network.

**This is an alpha.** It is published to be tried, not to be relied on. Read "Before you put funds
in it" below before doing anything with real money.

## Download

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| Mac, Apple Silicon (M1 and later) | `quai-terminal-<version>-macos-apple-silicon.tar.gz` |
| Mac, Intel | `quai-terminal-<version>-macos-intel.tar.gz` |
| Linux, x86-64 | `quai-terminal-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` |

`SHA256SUMS` covers every archive. Check it before unpacking:

```sh
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

## Running it on a Mac

These builds are **not signed or notarized**, so macOS quarantines them and the first run fails with
"cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified". That is Gatekeeper refusing an unsigned
download, not the wallet failing. Clear the quarantine flag on the binary you just unpacked:

```sh
tar -xzf quai-terminal-<version>-macos-apple-silicon.tar.gz
cd quai-terminal-<version>-macos-apple-silicon
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine quai-terminal
./quai-terminal
```

Only do that for a file you fetched from this page and checked against `SHA256SUMS`.

## Terminal

Any terminal works. **Ghostty** and **kitty** get the most: inline pixel graphics, the kitty keyboard
protocol, and automatic light/dark theming from the terminal's own background. Check what yours
reports:

```sh
./quai-terminal diagnostics terminal
```

`graphics_tier` of `Pixels` means images render as images; `light_background` shows whether the
background was successfully negotiated with the terminal.

## Before you put funds in it

Read this part.

- **No trading transaction from this wallet has ever been broadcast to Quai mainnet.** Trading is
  qualified by simulation against the deployed contracts and by execution on a disposable local
  chain. Sending and receiving are exercised; the trading write paths are not, on mainnet, by
  anyone, yet.
- It holds real keys. Back up your recovery phrase before funding anything, and try it with a small
  amount first.
- `wallet watch` creates a watch-only wallet that cannot sign. That is the safe way to look around.

## Start

```sh
./quai-terminal            # the TUI
./quai-terminal --help     # the commands
```
